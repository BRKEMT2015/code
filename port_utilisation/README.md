# USE CASE 1: Is there a need for more switches?

![alt text](/images/port_utilisation.png "Port Utilisation use case")

In this use case Antti needs to check the port utilisation of his network in order to verify whether he needs more switches or if there is already enough ports for future needs. For this we are using **Model Driven Programmability** with **Cisco IOS XE** switches. Our focus is on **Restconf** and **YANG models**.

## Getting Started
- Make sure you have installed the requirements.txt to have all the required libraries in your development environment
- Select which IOS XE device(s) you want to work with. Good option is to work with the IOS XE sandbox in the [DevNet Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/)

## Using POSTMAN with RESTCONF and an IOS XE switch
