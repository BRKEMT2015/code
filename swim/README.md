# USE CASE 2: Are all the network switvhes in correct software version?

![alt text](/images/swim.png "Software Image check use case")

In this use case Antti needs to check the software version that each of his devices in his network are running, to ensure that they are running on a safe version. This time however, Antti will programming against a controller, Cisco DNA Center, and leverage the already collected and structured data of the devices that DNA Center has to offer. 

## Getting Started
- Make sure you have installed the requirements.txt to have all the required libraries in your development environment
- Select which Cisco DNA Center you want to work with. Good option is to work with the Cisco DNA Center sandbox in the [DevNet Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/)

## Using POSTMAN with Cisco DNA Center APIs

First thing that we should do when learning to use a new API is to test it to see how it works and what kind of response we get. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is a great tool for this! Lets see how we would navigate and find the correct REST APIs of DNA Center to work with.

## A script utilising Cisco DNA Center SDK
